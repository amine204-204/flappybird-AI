This project develops an AI capable of learning to play Flappy Bird through the use of a genetic algorithm. A population of basic agents evolves across multiple generations, with each agent's performance assessed based on survival time and score. The highest-performing agents are selected, combined, and mutated to produce new generations, gradually enhancing the AI's ability to navigate obstacles and improve its gameplay over time.
Note that the project is written in JAVA.
